# Project Scope

This is a real-time weather app that allows a user to enter the name of their city and/or state/province and find out real-time weather information regarding said locality. The app is very intuitive in that it is very easy and simple to use. With one click, the user can find out accurate information regarding the weather from the city of their choice. 

Although simple, when building this app, there were a few issues we ran into regarding its construction. One issue was finding an appropriate API for usage. This presented a challenge because not all API's are created equally. Some API's required a foreign key while others did not. Some API's required CORS implementation, while others did not. Finding the appropriate API for this project was indeed challenging, but necessary to ensure the proper execution of the application. 

With regards to this project's connection to our pod's open source project, we installed the eslint-plugin-react extension to execute this application. We used this plugin because we wanted to ensure that the code was written with proper syntax. Furthermore, we used this plugin to ensure that the code was structured in accordance to React JS rules.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
